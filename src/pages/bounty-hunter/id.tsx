                The development target is the RP2040 microcontroller using the
                Go programming language that comes in the Pico W board package.
                TinyGo is the compiler which lets us compile Go code to the
                RP2040. The CYW43439 is connected to the RP2040 (Raspberry
                Pi&apos;s microcontroller) via SPI where SDO and SDI are shared
                on the same pin. The communication today in TinyGo happens via
                software (bitbang) SPI. The work done so far has been achieved
                by porting over the C version of the driver:
                georgerobotics/cyw43-driver. This driver is used by the SDK
                maintained by the Raspberry Pi foundation in
                raspberrypi/pico-sdk. Some functionality may also be needed from
                the pico-sdk repository.
